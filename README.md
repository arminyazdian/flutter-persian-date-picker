## ‚úèÔ∏è Quick Document:

```
/// This gets called when user selects a date and taps the Submit button.
/// use selectedDate.formatter to access all details of the user's selected date
///
/// It is recommended to call [pop] if you are using [PersianDatePicker] inside a BottomSheet / Dialog
final void Function(Jalali selectedDate) onSubmitDate;

/// This gets called when user has no selected date and taps the Submit button.
///
/// It is recommended to show a toast as a hint for the user
final void Function() onEmptyDateSubmit;

/// Simply pass a date if you wish to have a date to be selected initially. This is pretty useful
/// for situations where user has saved a date in your state management
final Jalali? chosenDate;

/// Leave this empty if you want your [PersianDatePicker] to contain the whole width of the screen
///
/// If there is a [Padding] widget as parent of this widget and you want it to have a desired width too,
/// simply make a sum of width and the padding. For example:
/// int desiredWidth = 400;
/// int horizontalPadding = 10;
/// widthWithPadding = desiredWidth + (horizontalPadding * 2)
///
/// If you only want a desired width and there are no [Padding] as it's parent, just pass the width
///
/// If there is [Padding] as it's parent and you want it to take the whole width,
/// make a sum of your padding and MediaQuery.of(context).size.width
final double? widthWithPadding;

/// TextStyle for week titles.
final TextStyle weekTitlesTextStyle;

/// ButtonStyle for header navigator buttons
